## Project Overview

The **Sentimental Analysis Bot** is designed to analyze text and predict whether the sentiment behind it is positive, negative, or neutral. The model uses **Bidirectional LSTM** architecture for sentiment classification.

Key features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, padding, and sequence creation.
- **Modeling**: Built using Bidirectional LSTM with Keras and TensorFlow.
- **Evaluation**: Model accuracy and performance metrics.
- **Deployment**: The bot can be integrated into various applications like chatbots.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- TensorFlow, Keras
- Other libraries (listed in requirements below)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or use it directly in Google Colab:

bash```
git clone https://github.com/rakshanakrish/Micro-IT-Internship.git
```
Install the required libraries (if you are using a local environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Usage
a)Running the Notebook:
Open the Sentimental_Bot.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab and run the cells sequentially.

b)Input Text:
Provide a text input (e.g., a sentence or paragraph) to see the sentiment prediction.

c)Training the Model:
The model will train on the given dataset. Once the model is trained, it will give you accuracy metrics on how well it performs.
